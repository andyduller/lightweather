This is a utility to process a number of data files produced by the
HeavyWeather software used for a variety of weather station hardware.

It attempts to create an sqlite database representing the data in the files.
I've had problems with data collection which mean that I have accumulated  a
number of data files over the years. Some of these have incorrect timestamps
as the date has been incorrectly set. In some cases the hourly data samples
have been collected at a few minutes before/past the hour. The software
attempts to allow you to correct these problems. This cannot always be done
automatically and you may need to change the script to cope with specific
problems that you have with datasets.

Command line switches are currently:

-a/--add2db: process a HeavyWeather data file and add data to the weather.db
  sqlite after processing the data. When data with the same timestamp as
  one already in the database it checks that the data matches.

-w/--writedb: write the contents of weather.db to a HeavyWeather format data
  file.

-s/--showdb: show the data ranges contained in weather.db. If a data element
  name is given on the commandline then the data values will be printed to
  stdout.
